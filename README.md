## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

For a few specific applications, we require environment variables. I've included a sample .env.example file for these essential projects. 
However, one crucial element needed for these projects is,

```env
DB_URL=
```

For full stack applications, we'll be using MongoDB as a database. So do create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) as well as 
install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) for creating local database instance for the project. 

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

<summary><code>hello-docker/Dockerfile</code></summary>

```dockerfile
# select the base image to run the app. We want to run a javascript app, so we use the node runtime image from docker hub
# we can use any image from docker hub. We can also use a custom image that we have created
# node:20-alpine -> node is the image name, 20-alpine is the tag
# alpine is a lightweight version of linux
# we can see complete list of node image tags here: https://hub.docker.com/_/node
FROM node:20-alpine

# set the working directory to /app. This is the directory where the commands will be run. We can use any directory name but /app is a standard convention
WORKDIR /app

# copy everything from the current directory to the PWD (Present Working Directory) inside the container. 
# First `.` is the path to the current directory on the host machine. Second `.` is the path to the current directory inside the container i.e., source and destination
# source - current directory on the host machine
# destination - current directory inside the container (/app)
COPY . .

# commands to run the app
CMD node hello.js

# build the image
# docker build -t hello-docker .
    # -t -> tag the image with a name
    # hello-docker -> name of the image
    # . -> path to the Dockerfile
```

# create a user with permissions to run the app
# -S -> create a system user
# -G -> add the user to a group
# This is done to avoid running the app as root
# If the app is run as root, any vulnerability in the app can be exploited to gain access to the host system
# It's a good practice to run the app as a non-root user
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app

# set the user to run the app

# set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
# This is done before copying the rest of the files to take advantage of Docker’s cache
# If the package.json and package-lock.json files haven’t changed, Docker will use the cached dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# sometimes the ownership of the files in the working directory is changed to root
# and thus the app can't access the files and throws an error -> EACCES: permission denied
# to avoid this, change the ownership of the files to the root user
USER root

# change the ownership of the /app directory to the app user
# chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>
